- 👋 Hi, I’m Marie-Charlotte Cheutin
- 👀 I’m interested in all the topics concerning the interactions between species from trophic relations, to parasitology and microbiology
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a wide range of analyses and technics to understand the intractions between enteric microbiomes, its hosts (specially reef fishes) and its environment.
My interests have always been focused on marine systems through marine parasites in coastal fishes, diet contents in sharks and in microbes/reef fish interactions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects concerning the evolution of the interactions between the microbe/parasite communities with its hosts, and how does evolve this system in an environment which suffered from anthropic and stress pressures.
- 📫 How to reach me : i'm actually working in MARBEC laboratory, in Montpellier (France) but it would be a pleasure to work or participate with a team in these previous topics!
