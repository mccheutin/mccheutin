- 👋 Hi, I’m Marie-Charlotte Cheutin
- 👀 I’m interested in all the topics concerning the interactions between species from trophic relations, to parasitology and microbiology
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a wide range of analysis and technics to understand the intreractions between enteric microbiome, its hosts (specially reef fishes) and its environment.
My thematics have always been focused on marine systems through marine parasites in coastal fishes, diet contents in sharks and in microbes/reef fish interactions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects concerning the evolution of the interactions between the microbiome or parasite with its hosts, and which would be the finality of a such system in an 
environment which suffered always more from anthropic and stress pressures.
- 📫 How to reach me : i'm actually working in MARBEC laboratory, in Montpellier (France) but it would be a pleasure to work or participate with a team in these previous topics!
